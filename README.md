## Template Matching Project

- Write a template matching algorithm (function) in python.
- It should be generic. This means any image and/or template can be given to it.
- Find a crowd picture on the internet (should not be same as other class fellows). Make your template from it in photoshop or paint. Apply the template matching function on it. Draw a box around the window with closest 3 matches.
